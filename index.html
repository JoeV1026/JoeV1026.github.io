            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Joseph, but most people call me Joey. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and expect to graduate in December 2026. I’m originally from New York, but now in Atlanta. Academically, I’m confident I can balance studying and working at Starbucks. I also enjoy attending different club meetings on campus to see what sparks my interest. However, I try my best to build not just connections, but friendships. When I’m not studying or working, you’ll find me at a social event. Where I eat free food and meet new people!
                Outside of school, I either work or teach myself something new. Recently, I’ve been learning guitar and have made lots of progress. I’m also teaching myself all about machine learning and data science. I even found a broken DJ set by a dumpster, noticed it was broken, fixed it, and started teaching myself how to use it. I’d say I’m pretty self-sufficient. I pay for my own housing, cook my own meals, and stay organized. I have to give credit to my grandma for the organized part, she always made me keep my room in order which transferred to my life. Moving to a new state and living on my own was a big step, but so far, it’s been an amazing journey! I always start my mornings at coffee shops, checking emails, and staying active on LinkedIn.
                This is the free-trial of who I am, but feel free to reach out! If you’re a hiring manager, I hope this highlights my determination, resourcefulness, sociability, organization, and passion for learning. You can find my contact details at the bottom of this page or use the navigation links at the top. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you have an incredible day!
